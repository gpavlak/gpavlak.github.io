Welcome! We are a multi-faceted team developing new solutions at the intersection of building science, data science, and optimization to reduce the energy use and carbon emissions associated with buildings. We aim to increase the efficiency, resiliency, and sustainability of buildings and communities by developing intelligent building control methods, and advanced modeling and systems analysis tools. Some of our current research topics include:

- Optimal co-design methods for zero carbon buildings
- Uncertainty-aware supervisory controls for grid-interactive building portfolios
- Scalability and transferability of intelligent building controls methods

The Building Energy Optimization Group (BEOG) is currently led by Assistant Professor Dr. Greg Pavlak. Please check out our [people]({{ "people/" | relative_url }}) and  [publications]({{ "publications/" | relative_url }}) pages to learn more about the team and our work!
