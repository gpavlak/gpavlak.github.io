abstract = {Maintaining control system performance over the lifespan of a building offers great potential for increasing system operation efficiency. Programming the building monitoring system with control loop performance assessment (CLPA) indices provides a way to identify poorly performing loops. This work further advances building control monitoring by developing an approach to help prioritize control problems based on the severity of their system-level impact. CLPA indices were added to a Modelica-based small office building model programmed with advanced heating, ventilating, and air conditioning control sequences. An extensive set of unique simulations of different levels of loop detuning were implemented to generate a database that contains both system-level performance metrics and CLPA indices. A regression model was then developed that combines individual loop performance to assess the impact on system-level outputs. Loops of the zone with higher heat gains and the air handling unit supply air temperature loop produced the greatest system-level impact.}

  abstract = "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles in the power grid, dealing with uncertainty in both supply and demand is critical to ensuring reliable and efficient operations. In this study, we discuss the value of a two­stage stochastic control framework for an aggregator to address such problems by promoting improved decision­ making and performance despite inherent uncertainty. An uncertainty­aware transactive control framework was de­ veloped to account for uncertainties in future conditions due to occupancy patterns, weather conditions, on­site power generation, and real­time pricing schemes. In the day­ahead period, the aggregator decides the electricity procurement plan considering the possible real­time control strategies for operation of the commercial building thermal energy stor­ age (TES) assets and residential building electric water heaters. During real­time operations, the aggregator modulates controllable loads based on transactive market mechanisms with model predictive control (MPC). In order to evaluate the performance, this study quantified the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) to analyze the cost of uncertain information and potential benefits of solving the stochastic optimal control problem. This paper demonstrates how the stochastic solution of the developed framework can provide useful information for customers and grid operators in the management of uncertain situations to support grid reliability and sustainability."

  abstract = "Building thermal energy storage has been utilized for decades for various objectives, such as reducing peak electrical demand, reducing building operating expenses, and increasing the efficiency of systems when charged from waste heat or free cooling. As building thermal storage control strategies become more dynamic, optimization of building performance often considers multiple objectives that aim to improve building performance in energy, economic, en- vironmental, and grid support categories. The dynamics of the incentive signal used for one objective, as well as its relation to signals from other objectives—for instance, whether the signals are “in sync” or are “conflicting”—heavily influence the tradeoffs that may exist among performance objectives. To better understand the degree of alignment that may exist between grid incentive signals, we apply unsupervised learning to a novel grid data set that includes hourly signals for energy price and marginal carbon emissions. Clustering algorithms identify common patterns in the dynamic signals. Overall, Hierarchical Clustering demonstrated the best performance, evaluated by DB index and Silhouette score. While the algorithms did not find distinctive patterns among the carbon signals, they did identify 7 to 9 patterns within the January and July pricing signals. The highly fluctuating nature of the carbon emission signals could lead to a diverse range of tradeoffs between building energy cost and carbon emission reduction objectives, if the signals were used as the basis for a building control optimization problem. This finding iterates the importance of un- derstanding incentive signal dynamics, in both individual and collective contexts, and the implications for development of new control technologies for grid-interactive buildings."

  abstract = "Advanced district thermal energy systems have the potential to achieve significant energy savings and facilitate the integration of renewable thermal resources and waste heat, contributing to reductions in carbon emissions. Such systems, also known as fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) systems, circulate water at temperatures close to ambient, and leverage electrically driven water-source heat pumps located at connected buildings to further temper the water. However, barriers exist to the adoption of 5GDHC systems, including the factorial growth in potential network configurations as a function of the number of considered buildings. Topology optimization, which seeks to answer the questions, “Which is the best subset of buildings, if any, to connect to a district thermal energy system, and by what network should they be connected, to minimize life cycle cost?” can accelerate the adoption of 5GDHC systems. This study is part of an effort to develop a topology optimization framework for district thermal energy systems. In this study, a heuristic for one important aspect of the topology optimization problem—the use of the minimal spanning tree network to connect a given set of buildings at the least life cycle cost—is validated."

  abstract = "Energy storage systems provide a wide range of technological approaches to manage the balance between energy supply and demand in the electric grid. With the increasing uncertainty and variability that comes with wide-spread adoption of grid-scale and behind-the-meter renewable energy, it is imperative to develop stochastic operational planning and control approaches that can account for uncertainty in future conditions. Although, coordination of multiple thermal energy storage resources can support the transition to low carbon energy by enabling valuable system flexibility, few stochastic planning and control approaches have been developed for coordinating building-level thermal energy storage resources. In addition, there is also a need to analyze the potential benefits of an aggregator-level stochastic control framework versus applying stochastic planning and controls at each building individually. This work addresses these needs by developing an uncertainty-aware transactive control (UA-Tx) framework for an aggregator to coordinate the thermal energy storage (TES) assets of multiple buildings. A two-stage stochastic optimization framework is formulated for day-ahead energy procurement that considers uncertainty in building occupancy patterns, weather conditions, and real-time energy prices of the following day. In the second stage, possible recourse decisions through modifying TES operation are also considered. The dispatch of TES operational strategies is implemented through transactive controls, which use market mechanisms and customer preferences to achieve changes in building demand. During real-time operation, a local demand response aggregator determines the transactive clearing prices to dispatch the flexibility enabled by TES. Simulation case studies were conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the uncertainty-aware aggregator control framework compared to the performance of applying intelligent controllers at each individual building. Up to 3.7% energy cost savings were observed for buildings under the UA-Tx aggregator control framework. Other potential benefits of the control approach are also discussed, along with anticipated future extensions."

	booktitle = {BEYOND 2020 -- World Sustainable Built Environment Conference, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science},
	abstract = {The residential sector accounts for 25% of global primary energy consumption. Two methods have previously been proposed to reduce residential energy use associated with the provision of occupant thermal comfort: 1. Occupancy-based HVAC control, operating systems only during confirmed occupancy, and 2. model predictive control (MPC), harnessing a mathematical model and forecasts to find optimal operating strategies. Previous studies estimate the average energy savings of the two methods individually in the range of 21% and 16%, respectively. The research presented herein was carried out to evaluate the energy savings potential in residential buildings by combining both approaches across different climates, house vintages, and occupancy patterns. Occupancy and eight different physical modalities (e.g. CO2 and VOC) data were collected from five homes for time periods of 4â9 weeks. Collected data sets were used to train occupancy prediction models suggested by an extensive literature survey of occupancy model types. The trained prediction models were combined with MPC and detailed EnergyPlus building simulation models to evaluate residential building performance in terms of annual energy savings and thermal comfort, along with discomfort exceedance metrics. Multiple home types and regions were analyzed to understand regional and climate-dependent potential. Based on actual field data, the occupancy models had a prediction inaccuracy between 8% and 35% across the investigated homes. Average occupancy for the collected data ranged from 56% to 86%, a typical range reported in the literature. Building simulations were conducted for three control scenarios: conventional thermostatic control, occupancy-based, and occupancy-based MPC. The results indicate that all advanced strategies improve upon the conventional control, with some scenarios cutting energy use in half with only occasional incurrence of discomfort. The findings indicate that occupancy-aware model predictive residential building control has the potential to drastically reduce energy use and associated emissions while maintaining occupant comfort for both new and existing buildings.}

	abstract = {Advanced district thermal energy systems, which circulate water at temperatures near ambient conditions, and facilitate the utilization of waste heat and renewable thermal sources, can lower the carbon-intensity of urban districts, advancing the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Optimization of the network topology â the selection of the best subset of buildings and the best network to connect them, to minimize life cycle cost â can increase adoption of these system in appropriate applications. The potential âsolution spaceâ of the topology optimization problem grows factorially with the number of buildings in the district, motivating the consideration of a design heuristic. In this study, a heuristic for the network selection was evaluated with an exhaustive search, for a prototypical four-building district. For the prototypical district considered, the heuristic was effective in selecting an optimal network topology. Additionally, it was found that, in this case, the selection of the subset of buildings was more influential on the life cycle cost than the selection of the network topology. This work is part of a larger effort to develop a topology optimization framework for district thermal energy systems, which is anticipated to address barriers to adoption of ambient-temperature systems.}

However, planning and adoption of district thermal energy systems is hindered by the analytical burden and high infrastructure costs. It is hypothesized that network topology optimization would enable wider adoption of advanced (ambient temperature) district thermal energy systems, resulting in energy savings. In this study, energy modeling is used to compare the energy performance of âconventionalâ and âadvancedâ district thermal energy systems at the urban district level, and a partial exhaustive search is used to evaluate a heuristic for the topology optimization problem. For the prototypical district considered, advanced district thermal energy systems mated with low-exergy building heating and cooling systems achieved a source energy use intensity that was 49% lower than that of conventional systems. The minimal spanning tree heuristic was demonstrated to be effective for the network topology optimization problem in the context of a prototypical district, and contributes to mitigating the problemâs computational complexity. The work presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of advanced district thermal energy systems to achieve deep energy savings, and advances to addressing barriers to their adoption through topology optimization.}

In this paper, we present an approach for sizing the microgrid components that accounts for the load flexibility available in buildings with model predictive control. As buildings are becoming smarter, the use of building control systems to regulate building load for different strategies, such as peak demand limiting or load shifting, is becoming increasingly prevalent. When sizing microgrid components under islanded operation, it becomes critical to consider the dynamic nature of the building load, since the intelligent control systems can use the building response to help balance energy flows. An optimal sizing and dispatch model of the microgrid with model predictive control is developed. Simulations are carried out for representative days for a building-level microgrid serving a medium-sized commercial building. Results show that savings in first costs and operational costs can be realized if advanced controls are considered during design and component selection.}

ASHRAE Guideline 36 (G36) â High-Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems, is the result of ASHRAE research project 1455-RP intended to develop standardized sequences of operation to achieve more effective use of existing controls. This paper complements G36 by evaluating the influence of the uncertainty inherent in the control components (e.g. sensors and actuators) on the system outputs of a multiple zone variable air volume (VAV) system. The system outputs under study were zone air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and site electricity use. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty in HVAC systems with advanced sequences of operation, this work applies a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to a detailed Modelica building energy model that has been programmed with G36 control sequences. Uncertainty models were integrated with the deterministic models of the building and the control sequence at small time scales to represent frequencies in which a real-world building automation system (BAS) samples its signals. The impact of uncertainty was quantified using annual simulations. Specification of the accuracy levels in the components of the control system were evaluated by the means of: 1) uncertainty analysis for low, medium, and high severities of accuracy in the components to identify relation between performance requirements and component accuracy, and 2) sensitivity analysis to identify the sensors and actuators where the impact of uncertainty on the system outputs is most influential.}

abstract={Buildings and construction account for 36% of global final energy use. As a solution, the Passive House (PH) standard, first developed by the Passive House Institute (PHI), Germany, prescribed three annual target criteria to reduce building energy consumption. Buildings built according to the PH standard have demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in annual space heating energy consumption and a 50% reduction in annual primary energy consumption (Schnieders & Hermelink, 2006). Since then, adopting these passive design strategies, projects around the world have produced results that provide researchers with valuable insights of the various aspects of performance of a passive house, including energy and thermal comfort. Given this background, the objective of this study is to examine performance of Passive Houses, both certified and uncertified, and identify some future trends of development of the PH standard, especially regarding the necessary adjustments of the standard for different climate zones.}

Residential HVAC systems often use manually-adjusted or constant setpoint temperatures, which heat and cool the house regardless of whether it is needed. By incorporating occupancy-awareness into HVAC control, heating and cooling can be used for only those time periods it is needed. Yet, bringing this technology to fruition is dependent on accurately predicting occupancy. Non-probabilistic prediction models offer an opportunity to use collected occupancy data to predict future occupancy profiles. Smart devices, such as a connected thermostat, which already include occupancy sensors, can be used to provide a continually growing collection of data that can then be harnessed for short-term occupancy prediction by compiling and creating a binary occupancy prediction. Real occupancy data from six homes located in Colorado is analyzed and investigated using this occupancy prediction model. Results show that non-probabilistic occupancy models in combination with occupancy sensors can be combined to provide a hybrid HVAC control with savings on average of 5.0% and without degradation of thermal comfort. Model predictive control provides further opportunities, with the ability to adjust the relative importance between thermal comfort and energy savings to achieve savings between 1% and 13.3% depending on the relative weighting between thermal comfort and energy savings. In all cases, occupancy prediction allows the opportunity for a more intelligent and optimized strategy to residential HVAC control.},

This study investigates two models: a deterministic and stochastic model. The deterministic model uses hourly demands of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reference large office building in San Francisco, CA and solar irradiance profiles in the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data as the independent variables. The stochastic model accounts for uncertainties in these independent variables using a Monte-Carlo method. The results show that regardless of PV penetration levels, the uncertainties in building energy demands and solar irradiance marginally influence the energy performance of CCHP+PV systems; however, they can notably increase annual operating costs up to $75,000 per year (13%). The annual cost increase is mainly attributed to a significant increase in demand charges (up to $79,000 per year). The demand charges tend to increase with higher uncertainties in the peak demand. The results suggest that in cases of the demand charge being responsible for a large portion in electricity bills (i.e., demand tariffs), a deterministic model tends to underestimate operating costs of CCHP+PV systems or other analogous distributed energy systems compared to a stochastic model. The errors with the deterministic model can become more extreme when demand charges outweigh energy charges."

The energy signal tool uses a traffic light visualization to alert a building operator to energy use which is substantially different from expected. The tool selects which light to display for a given energy end-use by comparing measured energy use to expected energy use, accounting for uncertainty. A red light is only displayed when a fault is likely enough, and abnormal operation costly enough, that taking action will yield the lowest cost result. While the theoretical advances and tool development were reported previously, it has only been tested using a basic building model and has not, until now, been experimentally verified. Expected energy use for the field demonstration is provided by a compact reduced-order representation of the Alliance Center, generated from a detailed DOE-2.2 energy model. Actual building energy consumption data is taken from the summer of 2014 for the office building immediately after a significant renovation project. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a first look at the building following its major renovation compared to the design intent. The tool indicated strong under-consumption in lighting and plug loads and strong over-consumption in HVAC energy consumption, which prompted several focused actions for follow-up investigation. In addition, this paper illustrates the application of Bayesian inference to the estimation of posterior parameter probability distributions to measured data. Practical discussion of the application is provided, along with additional findings from further investigating the significant difference between expected and actual energy consumption.}

abstract = {In order to achieve a sustainable energy future, advanced control paradigms will be critical at both building and grid levels to achieve harmonious integration of energy resources. This research explores the potential for synergistic effects that may exist through communal coordination of commercial building operations. A framework is presented for diurnal planning of multi-building thermal mass and HVAC system operational strategies in consideration of real-time energy prices, peak demand charges, and ancillary service revenues. Optimizing buildings as a portfolio achieved up to seven additional percentage points of cost savings over individually optimized cases, depending on the simulation case study. The magnitude and nature of synergistic effect was ultimately dependent upon the portfolio construction, grid market design, and the conditions faced by buildings when optimized individually. Enhanced energy and cost savings opportunities were observed by taking the novel perspective of optimizing building portfolios in multiple grid markets, motivating the pursuit of future smart grid advancements that take a holistic and communal vantage point.}

  abstract = "A prototype energy signal tool is demonstrated for operational whole-building and system-level energy use evaluation. The purpose of the tool is to give a summary of building energy use which allows a building operator to quickly distinguish normal and abnormal energy use. Toward that end, energy use status is displayed as a traffic light, which is a visual metaphor for energy use which is substantially different from expected (red and yellow lights) or more or less the same as expected (green light). Which light to display for a given energy end-use is determined by comparing expected energy use to actual energy use. As expected energy use is necessarily uncertain, we cannot choose the appropriate light with certainty. Instead the energy signal tool chooses the light by minimizing the expected cost of displaying the wrong light. The expected energy use is represented by a probability distribution. Energy use is modeled by a low-order lumped parameter model. Uncertainty in energy use is quantified by a Monte Carlo exploration of the influence of model parameters on energy use. Distributions over model parameters are updated over time via Bayes' theorem. The simulation study is devised to assess whole building energy signal accuracy in the presence of uncertainty and faults at the submetered level, which may lead to tradeoffs at the whole building level not detectable without submetering."

  abstract = "Providing ancillary services through flexible load response has the potential to increase electric grid reliability and efficiency while offering loads a revenue generating opportunity. The large power draw of commercial buildings, along with thermal mass characteristics, has sparked interest in providing ancillary services through intelligent operation of building mechanical systems. As a precursor to participating in ancillary service markets, the quantity of service available must be estimated. This work presents a model-based approach for estimating commercial building frequency regulation capability. A model predictive control framework is proposed to determine optimal operating strategies in consideration of energy use, energy expense, peak demand, economic demand response revenue, and frequency regulation revenue. The methodology is demonstrated through simulation for medium office and large office building applications, highlighting its ability to merge revenue generating opportunities with traditional demand and cost reducing objectives."

abstract = {Bayesian and nonlinear least-squares methods of calibration were evaluated and compared for gray-box modeling of a retail building. Gray-box model calibration is one form of system identification and is examined here with perturbations to the simple yet popular European Committee for Standardization (CEN)-ISO thermal network model. The primary objective was to understand whether the computational expense of probabilistic Bayesian techniques is required to provide robustness to signal noise, specifically with regard to lower dimensional problems (physical or semiphysical), where model calibration is preferred over uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian approach allows parameter interactions and trade-offs to be revealed, one form of sensitivity analysis, but its full power for uncertainty quantification cannot be harnessed with gray-box or other simplified models. Surrogate data from a detailed building energy simulation program were used to ensure command over latent variables, whereas a range of signal-to-noise and noise colors were considered in the experimental study. The fidelity to the building zone temperature and thermal load was the basis for comparing results. Utilization of uniform priors showed that both methods performed similarly well. Bayesian calibration outperformed traditional methods on noisy data sets; however, traditional methods were adequate up to an approximately 25% noise level. The thermal gray-box model calibration has the intended application of embedded model predictive control, where speed, accuracy, and robustness are crucial. Traditional methods required approximately 100 times less CPU time and are recommended given the model simplicity, application, and expected system noise levels.}

  abstract = "Probabilistic and nonlinear least squares parameter estimation methods are evaluated for inverse gray box model identification of a retail building. A detailed building energy simulation program is used to generate surrogate data for estimation of parameters. The most probable or optimal parameters from each method are compared through simulation of building zone temperature and thermal loads. The least squares method generally found solutions near probable regions of the posterior from the probabilistic approach, and simulation performance was very similar between best parameter sets. A brief overview of probabilistic estimation techniques is provided, along with potential improvements to the approach presented and brief discussion on its applicability for uncertainty quantification within the building science domain."
